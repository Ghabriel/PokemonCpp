<h3 id="scripting">Scripting a move</h3>

<p>Most simple moves fit in one of the possible function codes, and thus don't need a script. There are, however, moves that combine several effects or introduce completely new ones, in which case the function code 99 should be used. A move that has function code 99 <strong>does nothing by itself</strong>, it simply makes the game look for the move's effect somewhere else: the <strong>moves.lua</strong> file.</p>

The moves.lua file contains functions of the form:
<code>function MoveName_eventType
    -- script content here...
end
</code>

For example, a possible implementation of the move Tail Whip is as follows:
<code>function TailWhip_onUse()
    lowerStat(stats.defense, 1)
end
</code>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tail Whip is simple enough that the JSON file can fully represent its effect, but it's implemented here as a script for demonstration
purposes.</p>

<p>During battle, the game will call these functions according to the moves used and the current state of the battle. The following events are currently supported:</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Event</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Parameters</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>onUse</td>
            <td>Called when the move is used.</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>onDamageReceived</td>
            <td>Called when the user receives damage while the move is in effect.</td>
            <td>
                <strong>damage</strong> (int) - the damage received
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>onTurnStart</td>
            <td>Called at the start of the turn that the move is used or is in effect.</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>onTurnEnd</td>
            <td>Called at the end of the turn that the move is used or is in effect.</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
